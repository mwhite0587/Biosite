      <h3>Aerospace Engineer</h3>
      <p>What is an Aerospace engineer? That was a very good question to Alleyah's mother!</p>
      <p>Aerospace engineers specialize in the design, development, and testing of aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, and associated systems. By applying principles of physics, mathematics, and engineering, they innovate cutting-edge technologies for diverse applications such as transportation, communication, and space exploration. Their responsibilities span from initial design and prototyping to testing, overseeing manufacturing processes, and ensuring ongoing maintenance of these complex systems.</p>
